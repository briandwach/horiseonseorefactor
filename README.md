# Horiseon Website Refactoring

## The goal of this project was to update Horiseon's website so that it follows accessibility standards and is optimized for search engines.  

I learned the following:
- How to follow the Scout Rule and leave someone else's code cleaner than it was delivered to me.
- How to update an HTML document so it follows a more semantic structure. 
- How to clean up a CSS stylesheet to remove redundant style properties and make it easier to navigate.
- How to add alt attributes to image elements, a concise title, and ordered headings to improve accessibility and search engine optimization.

## Usage

The final website can be viewed here:
https://briandwach.github.io/horiseonseorefactor

- Please use the 3 navigation links at the top, right of the page in order to test functionality of the links on the page.  (You may need to change the horizontal window size to test the last 2 links)
